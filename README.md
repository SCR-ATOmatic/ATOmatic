# ATOmatic
A semi-automatic OCR ATO rendition.

## Getting Started
ATOmatic works on Optical Character Recognition (OCR) to identify signal aspects, speed limits and distances.

## Capabilities
PyATO is in a Pre-Rekease Stage, but at this time it is able to:
Drive any train to a certain speed limit, Acknowledge AWS, Stop at Stations with automatic opening and closing of doors, Drive at caution according to AWS signals.
At this time, ATOmatic cannot do the following:
Stop at specific car stop markers (sorry dispatchers), stop within the full platform length at certain stations, drive up at caution to danger aspect signals.
